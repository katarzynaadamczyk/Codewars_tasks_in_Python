# Different tasks solved using Python.
Some interesting tasks I found and solved them using Python 3. This project is under development, when I find something interesting I keep adding it to this repository.

## Automate_the_boring_stuff
My solutions to projects described in 'Automate the boring stuff with Python' by Albert Sweigart. Each individual .py file solves problem given at the end of its title's chapter (e.g. chapter_3.py solves problem described at the end of chapter 3, etc.). 

## Caesar_2:
Second variation on Ceasar cipher, task from codewars.com (https://www.codewars.com/kata/55084d3898b323f0aa000546).

## Chain_lightning_challenge:
My solution to challenge: https://challengerocket.com/chain-lightning-challenge/. Further description is in description.txt in the folder Chain_lightning_challenge.

## Crack_the_pin:
Solution to following problem found on Codewars: https://www.codewars.com/kata/5efae11e2d12df00331f91a6

## Determine_if_number:
Solution to following problem found in Daily Interview Pro newsletter (https://www.techseries.dev/daily):<br>
Given a string that may represent a number, determine if it is a number. Here's some of examples of how the number may be presented:<br>
'"123" # Integer'<br>
'"12.3" # Floating point'<br>
'"-123" # Negative numbers'<br>
'"-.3" # Negative floating point'<br>
'"1.5e5" # Scientific notation'<br>
Here's some examples of what isn't a proper number:<br>
'"12a" # No letters'<br>
'"1 2" # No space between numbers'<br>
'"1e1.2" # Exponent can only be an integer (positive or negative or 0)'<br>
Scientific notation requires the first number to be less than 10, however to simplify the solution assume the first number can be greater than 10. Do not parse the string with int() or any other python functions.

## Int32_to_IPv4:

## Play_with_arrays:
Solution to problems regarding arrays.
* Circles - my solution to following problem: You are given n numbers on a circle, described by an array A. Find the maximum number of neighbouring pairs whose sums are even. One element can belong to only one pair.
* Minimum_moves - my solution to problem found on: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements-ii

## Play_with_two_strings:

## Tasks_about_strings:
Solutions to problems with strings.
* break_a_palindrome - Given a palindromic string of lowercase English letters palindrome, replace exactly one character with any lowercase English letter so that the resulting string is not a palindrome and that it is the lexicographically smallest one possible
* burrows_wheeler_transformation - Solution to following problem found on Codewars: https://www.codewars.com/kata/54ce4c6804fcc440a1000ecb
* find_first_unique_letter - find the most efficient way to find the first unique letter in given string
* rle - Solution to following problem found on Codewars: https://www.codewars.com/kata/546dba39fa8da224e8000467
