Complete the code whose purpose is determining statistics of dead units after casting chain lightning - 
the spell known from Heroes of Might and Magic game series. 
In this code we consider a simplified version of the problem, in which units are located in one dimension list (battlefield) 
and the lightning hits always the unit closest to the zero index. Next it jumps to max three next units. 
The first strike has a power equaling 25 * caster's spell power and every next strike is two times weaker. 
Cast never hits unit with resistance 100 (lightning skip this unit).

The units consist of such parts of data:

    a type
    an owner ('player' or 'opponent')
    a number of hitpoints
    a number of creatures in the unit
    a resistance to lightning spells as a percentage (-100 ≤ resistance ≤ 100)


Unit{

 String type;

 String owner;

 int hitpoints;

 int number;

 int resistance;

}


The damage should be calculated by the formula: damage = strike power * (100% - unit's resistance). 
Resistance less then 0 means vulneability to lightning spells (can get more damage then strike power). 
A whole unit always loses the number of hitpoints equaling the sustained damage (with an exception for the overkill case). 
The spell always kills the maximal number of creatures possible to kill by removing the given number of hitpoints. 
Sometimes it leaves one unit wounded and it always remains the rest (if it survived) healthy. 
If the lightning reaches the end of the array, it always stops (after striking the fourth or last unit in battlefield).


The chain_spell_solve function should return a list including two other lists: 
first containing information about player's losses and the second - about opponent's ones. 
Eg. if 1 creature from Royal Griffin type unit was killed, list shoud contain: "1 Royal Griffin" , 
124 creatures from Pikeman unit: "124 Pikemans", etc

Example unit tests

type, owner, hitpoints, number, resistance = "type", "owner", "hitpoints", "number", "resistance"

arr = [
  None,
  { type: "Mage", owner: 'player', hitpoints: 30, number: 9, resistance: 0},
  None,
  { type: "Steel Golem", owner: 'opponent', hitpoints: 35, number: 60, resistance: 50 },
  None,
  None,
  { type: "Roc", owner: 'player', hitpoints: 40, number: 30, resistance: 0 },
  { type: "Sprite", owner: 'opponent', hitpoints: 2, number: 120, resistance: 0 }
]
power = 100
answer = [['9 Mages', '15 Rocs'], ['17 Steel Golems', '120 Sprites']]
self.assertEqual(chain_spell_solve(arr, power), answer)
